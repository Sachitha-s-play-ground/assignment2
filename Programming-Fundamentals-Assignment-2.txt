Task 1.
Statistically Typed Languages are the programming languages that checking type at the compile
time, while Dynamically Typed Languages are the programming languages that checking type at the
run time.
Strongly Typed Languages are the programming languages that consider the type of data strictly
while Loosely Typed Languages are the programming languages that don’t consider the type of data
strictly.
Java is a statistically typed and strongly typed programming language


Task2.
Case sensitive – upper case and lower case letters in identifiers are treated as two different
identifiers.
Example
int variable = 42;
int Variable = 23;
System.out.println(variable);
System.out.println(Variable);
here, no errors and gives values separately.
Java is case sensitive
Case insensitive – it does not differentiate between uppercase and lowercase.
Example treat variable / Variable / VARIABLE as same.
SQL is case insensitive
Case Sensitive-Insensitive – mixed with case insensitive and case sensitive.
Example
treat myVariable and MyVariable as different and treat if and IF as same
JavaScript is Case Sensitive-Insensitive
