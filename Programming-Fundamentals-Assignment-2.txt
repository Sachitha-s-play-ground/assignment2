Task 1.
Statistically Typed Languages are the programming languages that checking type at the compile
time, while Dynamically Typed Languages are the programming languages that checking type at the
run time.
Strongly Typed Languages are the programming languages that consider the type of data strictly
while Loosely Typed Languages are the programming languages that don’t consider the type of data
strictly.
Java is a statistically typed and strongly typed programming language


Task2.
Case sensitive – upper case and lower case letters in identifiers are treated as two different
identifiers.
Example
int variable = 42;
int Variable = 23;
System.out.println(variable);
System.out.println(Variable);
here, no errors and gives values separately.
Java is case sensitive
Case insensitive – it does not differentiate between uppercase and lowercase.
Example treat variable / Variable / VARIABLE as same.
SQL is case insensitive
Case Sensitive-Insensitive – mixed with case insensitive and case sensitive.
Example
treat myVariable and MyVariable as different and treat if and IF as same
JavaScript is Case Sensitive-Insensitive

Task3.
Identity Conversion is a type of type conversion that involves assigning a value to a variable of the
same type, or passing an argument to a method where the argument's type matches the parameter
type exactly.
Example
int number = 42;
int anotherNubmer = number;
long myLong = 151316;
long myNextLong = myLong;
here firstly, a value is assigned to number and that number is assigned to another variable with same
type.

Task4.
Primitive widening conversions are converting a variable with a lesser bits to a variable with a
higher bits. These happen implicitly.
Byte>short>int>long
float>double
